# 🏀 NBA MVP Predictor

A Python-based machine learning project designed to predict the NBA's MVP (Most Valuable Player) based on historical player statistics. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify key features that contribute to winning the MVP award.

## 📖 Overview
This project uses a Jupyter Notebook to build models that predict the likelihood of a player winning the MVP title. The predictor analyzes various statistics from past NBA seasons to find patterns in MVP selections.

## 🛠 Features
- **Data Analysis**: Visualizes trends and patterns in player performance and MVP wins.
- **Model Building**: Uses algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict MVP winners.
- **Feature Engineering**: Processes player statistics (points, assists, rebounds, etc.) crucial for MVP selection.

## 🔢 Dataset
- The dataset includes historical NBA player statistics.
- Features cover metrics such as points per game, assists, rebounds, and other advanced stats.
- Data is imported as CSV files for analysis in the notebook.

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- Models used:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
- Used error metric average precision to see how many of the top 5 were predicted correctly.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves for assessing model performance.
